## GPU Lecture

Goals of this lecture:

- If I recall correctly, PL Survey is supposed to fit into the Sophomore year.
If that is true, then the students in this class either might or might have 
not taken Operating Systems. If they haven't taken OS, it will be good to have
a bit of an overview of the GPU and how GPU programming differs from CPU 
programming.

- Introduce the necessary hardware considerations addressed in 
[Programming Massively Parallel Processors](https://bit.ly/2PXocnt). The book
references several things about the GPU that would be critical information for
understanding parallel code on the GPU.

- Go over the history of GPU programming. 

- Introduce CUDA and explain what it is.
