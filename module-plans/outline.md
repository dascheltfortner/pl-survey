## Outline of Module Lectures

#### Lecture 1: GPU Overview

###### Summary

I think it would be a good idea to get into the differences between 
GPUs and CPUs, and give a brief history lesson of GPU programming.
Programming in CUDA C without understanding the processor would be like
programming in normal C without understanding the processor: you could
do it, but you probably shouldn't. So, the first lecture of the module
should cover the architecture of a GPU and describe what makes 
parallel programming different and how GPU programming works at the level
of the GPU.
